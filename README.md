# FastAPI
This is a repo demonstrating continuous delivery of a Fast API on AWS (IDS 706 Project 2).  
  
This project demonstrates how to use introductory-level Fast API functions with an already completed API. I modify it slightly by posting an image on the root page, and utilize string formatting to include a variety of user input.  
  


### Step 1: Create a new Repository and C9 environment
- create a new respository in GitHub
- create a new C9 environment
- open the IDE
- generate new SSH keys
- clone the repository into the environment
- navigate into the repository and create python virtual environment
- create project scaffolding

### Step 2: Find an API
I am using an already completed FastAPI to work off of, which can be found [here](https://github.com/tapaswenipathak/Horoscope-API). It is a horoscope generator that requires a time-frame and zodiac sign as URL inputs.

### Step 3: Create Fast API
See the main.py file.

### Step 4: Create Testing File
See the test_main.py file

### Step 5: Deploy Github Actions for Automated Testing

### Step 6: Connect to AWS App Runner
